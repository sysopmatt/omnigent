"""Transport drivers: launch a harness and drive turns for the probes.

A driver hides the transport (how a turn is started and how events come
back) behind a small harness-agnostic surface the probes call. The only
driver today is :class:`SdkInprocDriver`, which spawns a single harness
wrap subprocess via :class:`HarnessProcessManager` and drives turns over
the wrap's ``POST /v1/sessions/{conv}/events`` SSE endpoint — the same
path exercised by ``tests/e2e/test_harness_wrap_e2e.py``.

Native transports (tmux TUI, app-server, HTTP/SSE) are phase-2 drivers
keyed by :attr:`BenchProfile.transport`; a profile on a transport with no
driver yields :meth:`unavailable`, and the bench renders its
transport-dependent probes as ``SKIPPED``.
